ALcolTrol is a creative take on a serious issue: alcohol consumption and its potential consequences, especially when mixed with driving.
Born as a final project for a Social Robotics course, this device combines electronics, coding, and a bit of irony to raise awareness in a playful, interactive way.
At its core, ALcolTrol is a personal breathalyzer that detects alcohol concentration in your breath using an MQ-3 gas sensor, processes the data through Arduino UNO, and gives immediate feedback â€” visually, audibly, and even wirelessly.
We wanted something that could be used with friends at a party just for fun, but also something that could spark a moment of self-reflection. And thatâ€™s where ALcolTrol comes in.

How it works:
When you breathe near the sensor, ALcolTrol:
	1.	Measures the ethanol concentration in the air (your breath)
	2.	Calculates a rough Blood Alcohol Content (BAC)
	3.	Shows the result on an LCD display
	4.	Lights up one of four LEDs to indicate your level:
ðŸ”µ Normal â€” ðŸŸ¡ Tipsy â€” ðŸ”´ Drunk â€” ðŸ”´ Wasted
	5.	Plays different tones with a buzzer
	6.	Sends all the data via Bluetooth to a connected Android device

What we used:
â€¢ Arduino UNO 
â€¢ MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor 
â€¢ HC-05 Bluetooth Module 
â€¢ 4 LEDs + resistors (220Î©) 
â€¢ 1 Buzzer 
â€¢ 1 LCD 16x2 Display with potentiometer 

The App Side
While the main fun happens in the hardware, we also designed a small Android app using MIT App Inventor.
It connects via Bluetooth, reads the data in real time, and shows personalized messages based on your BAC.
